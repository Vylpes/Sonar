## Repository

The repository is developed on my [GitLab instance](https://gitlab.vylpes.com/Vylpes/Sonar).

It is also mirrored to [GitHub](https://github.com/vylpes/sonar), this is a read only repo and won't have any changes made directly to it.

Creating issues you've found is fine on GitHub, and I will create an issue on GitLab for it, but progress made by me will be set on GitLab.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

We will not merge pull requests unless all checks pass and at least one of the repo members approves it.

See CONTRIBUTING.md for more details.
